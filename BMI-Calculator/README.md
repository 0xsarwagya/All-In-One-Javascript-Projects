# BMI Calculator

**A simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**  
This calculator helps users calculate their BMI by entering their height and weight and also provides a guide for interpreting the result.

### Functionalities
- **BMI Calculation**: Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on height in centimeters and weight in kilograms.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures valid numeric inputs for height and weight, providing feedback for invalid inputs.
- **BMI Range Guide**: Displays a guide for interpreting BMI ranges (Underweight, Normal, Overweight).

## Description
This is a basic web-based BMI calculator that allows users to input their height and weight to calculate their BMI. The BMI is calculated using the following formula:

**BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (cm) * Height (cm) / 10000)**

Where:
- **Weight (kg)** is the person's weight in kilograms.
- **Height (cm)** is the person's height in centimeters.

The result is displayed on the screen along with a color-coded message based on the calculated value. The app also shows a BMI weight guide to help users understand where their BMI falls in terms of underweight, normal, and overweight categories.

# Word Length Calculator

**A simple tool to calculate the length of a word**  
This project allows users to input a word, then calculates and displays the word's length when the button is clicked.

### Functionalities
- **Word Input**: Users can input a word in the text field provided.
- **Length Calculation**: The length of the word is calculated and displayed upon clicking the button.
- **Clear Output Display**: The result is shown in a clean and easy-to-read format.

## Description
This simple project demonstrates how to capture user input, process it, and display the result dynamically using JavaScript. The core functionality is centered around calculating the length of the inputted word and displaying it in real-time when a button is clicked.

### Key Concepts:
- **DOM Manipulation**: The project uses native JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, capturing user input and updating the HTML dynamically.
- **Event Handling**: A click event is used to trigger the calculation and update the result.

### Edge Cases & Assumptions:
- If no word is entered, the result will display "0" as the length.
- Whitespace before or after the word is counted as part of the string length, as there is no trimming applied.

## Prerequisites
No additional libraries are required as the project uses native JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
